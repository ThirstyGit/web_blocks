# Web Blocks
This is the start of a repository which will contain all the building blocks I may need for creating a website. All the little things.

`Do not forget to add necessary css class.`

## Components.

### Message.
This can be used with inputs. (Need to try others.)

Inside a message-container class have the input first then the message class. Inside the message class Write whatever you want to 

Example code:
```html
  <div class="message-container">
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password" name="Password">
    <div class="message">
      Message goes here.
    </div>
  </div>
```
